## Original script created by Robbie Vance here: http://pleasework.robbievance.net/howto-get-webroot-endpoints-using-unity-rest-api-and-powershell/
## Script altered by Kevin Byrd to provide an additional method of sending/managing Agent Commands and usage reports via Unity API.
## This script requires that Powershell Scripts be enabled to run on the OS, this can often be disabled via GPO.
## Requires .Net Framework 4.5 + \ Powershell 3.0 or newer.
## Windows PowerShell 3.0 requires the full installation of Microsoft .NET Framework 4. Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 include Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 by default, which fulfills this requirement.
## THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL WEBROOT SCRIPT NOR IS IT SUPPORTED BY WEBROOT
